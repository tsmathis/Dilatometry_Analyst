## *Quick Start Guide*

After launching Dilatometry Analyst, you'll see an empty data window which will show different previews of your processed data
once your data is imported.

**Data Import**: This application was designed to process data generated with an El-Cell ECD-3-nano electrochemical dilatometer[^1] used in conjunction with a BioLogic potentiostat. Dilatometry Analyst assumes your data is in the form of .txt files (contained within a single folder) that were generated by BioLogic's EC-Lab software[^2], see below for instructions for exporting data from EC-lab.

***To successfully import data***, your files should at minimum have data columns for time, potential, current, cycle number, and displacement. The application also expects that your data files are numbered in the order that the measurements were performed, *e.g.*, file_name_01, file_name_02, file_name_03, *etc*. This is mainly for the normalization process, see the *Data Processing and Exported Data* section for further details.

**Data export**: Dilatometry Analyst will export three Excel files containing your processed data. The numbering for the sheets in the Excel files correspond to the numbers of the files you imported, *i.e.*, Sheet_01 corresponds to file_name_01, Sheet_02 corresponds to file_name_02, *etc*.

## *Exporting .txt files from EC-Lab*

If you have never exported your data as .txt files from EC-Lab, the "Text File Export" dialog can be found under Experiment->Export as Text..., or by using the shortcut Ctrl+T. Selecting "Custom*" in the Template menu will allow you to choose what data (referred to as "Variables" in EC-Lab) will be included in your .txt file. You can choose to export all, or just the required data. Dilatometry Analyst requires the following columns, or "Variables": 'time/s', 'Ewe/V', '\<I>/ma', 'cycle number', and 'Analog IN 1/V'. 'Analog IN 1/V' is how EC-Lab referes to the displacement data that was recorded by the El-Cell dilatometer.

## *Directly Recording Signals from External Devices with EC-Lab*

In order for EC-Lab to properly record the input signals from the dilatometer, it is important to load the experiment settings for the dilatometer in the "External Devices" menu of EC-Lab ***before*** starting your experiment. An example is shown here, but it is recommended to consult the dilatometer manual provided by El-Cell for further instruction.[^3]

If you do not have a BioLogic branded potentiostat, your system likely has a similar process for recording signals from external devices with your potentiostat, so it is best to consult your instrument's user manual.

If you cannot directly record the input signals from your dilatometer using EC-Lab, it is still possible to use Dilatometry Analyst to process your data. However, you will have to perform some extra work to successfully join your electrochemical data to your dilatometry data prior to use. See the "*How to Externally Combine Electrochemical and Dilatometry Data*" section at the bottom of this page.

## *How to Externally Combine Electrochemical and Dilatometry Data*

*Note: The EC-Link software from El-Cell allows for recording potential, current, and there is a mention of a method of distinguishing between cycles in the documentaion for EC-Link. So it may be possible to directly generate files with EC-Link that are compatible with Dilatometry Analyst, but this has not been tested at this point.*

If it is not possible for you to directly record signals from your dilatometer using EC-Lab, or your non-BioLogic branded potentiostat's software, the data recorded using El-Cell's software (EC-Link[^4]) can still be joined with your electrochemical data. This will first require you to match the data sampling rates of your potentiostat's software with the EC-Link software as closely as you can. The images below show this process for EC-Lab's CVA technique and the EC-Link software. This will

Unfortunately, you will have to stop and restart the EC-Link software before changing electrochemical techniques, *e.g.*, changing the scan rate or the C-rate, to ensure you will have individual dilatometry data files corresponding to your electrochemical measurements.

The next step relies on the fact that EC-Link automatically records your system time during measurements. It is also possible to export data from EC-Lab with the elasped time in your measurements being expressed in system time (absolute time). An example is shown here:

**image here**

From here, you will have to perform a database-style inner join on your electrochemical and dilatometry data files using the system time as the field name to join on. The Pandas library from Python has a convienent funcitnn for this (merge_asof[^5]) that will join your data files on the *nearest* key, instead of on exact matches. This will minimize the amount of data lost in the join due to any differences in the sampling rates of EC-Lab (or your pontentiostat's software) and EC-Link. You will need then need to convert the system time, or absolute time, into elapsed time (in units of seconds). At this point your files will be compatible with Dilatometry Analyst.
